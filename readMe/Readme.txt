	File Handling

Confirming File Count

In Windows, right click on the top level folder of the archive and select properties to view the number or files and folders contained in this folder.  Compare these numbers to those in the filecount_total.txt document found in the filecount folder.  They should match.  The filecount_total.txt document refers to the original archive filename from when it was first created.  This name contains a Project ID followed by date and time.  The name of your archive folder may have been changed.

Copying Archives to an Internal Drive

When moving or copying archives, keep your file path short.  Use C:\Multivista\Archives or another folder location, but keep it under 40 characters.  Archives may use 215 of the 256 total available characters leaving only 41 for your file path.  Exceeding 256 total characters in your file path will cause an error that will not allow you to copy all the files.  Creating folders on your desktop will include a couple of extra folders in the path that will increase the length vs placing the archive in a root directory.

Copying Archives to an External Drive

Before copying archives to an external drive, format the drive to NTFS.  NTFS is the default file system for Windows, but it can also be read on a Mac.  If your intended user wants to write additional files to the archive disk, then use exFAT.  exFAT has been Mac compatible since Mac OS X Lion in 2011.  Plan on leaving at least 25% empty space on your drive.  Flash drives don't give you the full usable space advertised.  Write speeds decrease as a Flash drive fills up.  Check the file count after your transfer is complete.  Compare it to the filecount_total.txt document.

Archive File Naming

You may rename the top level folder of a project archive to something more meaningful.  But all of the files and folders contained within should remain unchanged.  Renaming, deleting or moving files and folders in the archive will most likely break the archive.   When changing the name of the top level folder of an archive, keep the new name short to avoid exceeding the maximum file path as this will break the archive.  Do not use any spaces, or the following special characters < > : " / \ | ? * in your folder name.


	Included Content

Archives may contain Floorplans, Photos, Webcams and Videos.  Archives may also contain user generated Comments, Photos and Documents.  The following content types are not included in project archives and require a Multivista login for access, SITE-WALK 360Â°, UAV MAPPING, UAV PANORAMAS and QA/QC List.
